- A simple kaggle Notebook for demonstration of CNN architecture
# What is LeNet  ? :
- In general, LeNet refers to LeNet-5 and is a simple convolutional neural network.
- Convolutional neural networks are a kind of feed-forward neural network whose artificial neurons can respond to a part of the surrounding cells in the coverage range and perform well in large-scale image processing.
# What is CNN ? :
- A convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) is a network architecture for deep learning that learns directly from data.
- CNNs are particularly useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, classes, and categories.
- They can also be quite effective for classifying audio, time-series, and signal data.
